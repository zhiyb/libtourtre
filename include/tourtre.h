    \mainpage libtourtre: A Contour Tree Library
    \image html tourtre.jpg
    \htmlonly
    <center>
    libtourtre is a library for con<u>tourtre</u>es. Tourtre is the French name
    for a bird. Here is a picture of said bird on a tree.
    </center>
    \endhtmlonly

    \section Introduction

    This library implements the contour tree construction algorithm outlined in
    the paper "Computing Contour Trees in All Dimensions"
    \htmlonly <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/carr99computing.html">[link]</a> \endhtmlonly
    by Carr, Snoeyink and Axen, and variant of another algorithm
    described in "Multi-Resolution computation and presentation of Contour
    Trees"
    \htmlonly <a href="http://pascucci.org/pdf-papers/orrery-2005.pdf">[link]</a> \endhtmlonly
    by Pascucci, Cole-McLaughlin and Scorzelli, which computes the so-called
    "branch decomposition." The algorithms are separate, but the latter depends
    on the former. The library contains three data structures (Arc, Node and
    Branch) that are convenient for representing the tree and its branch
    decomposition.

    \section Features

    A contour tree can be extracted from any scalar function defined on a
    domain which satisfies certain properties.  These properties are described in
    \htmlonly <a href="http://www.cs.ucd.ie/staff/hcarr/home/">Hamish Carr's</a>\endhtmlonly
    dissertation (if not elsewhere), but it suffices to say that it it works on
    simplicial complexes of genus zero. If your simplicial complex has holes,
    then you're looking for a Reeb graph, which is another algorithm. With some
    preprocessing, it can also be used for bilinearly and trilinearly
    interpolated images. For general image data, your best (easiest) bet is to
    impose a simplicial domain over the image.

    A feature of this library is that it produces a mapping from vertices of
    the domain to arcs (branches) of the contour tree (branch decomposition),
    which can be very handy.

    The algorithms in the library are serial, but the library is reentrant,
    should you need to compute another contour tree in one of the callbacks ...
    or something.

    \section Usage

    Include tourtre.h in your program.  Call ct_init() to create a ctContext,
    then call ct_sweepAndMerge() to create the contour tree and (optionally)
    ct_decompose() to transform it into a branch decomposition.

    The contour tree is made up of \link ctNode nodes \endlink and \link ctArc
    arcs \endlink, which form an acyclic graph. The branch decomposition is
    composed of \link ctBranch branches \endlink which form a rooted tree.
