% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

\usepackage{float}


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
This exercise aims to accelerate the minimal contour tree (libtourtre \cite{libtourtre}) algorithm. Different topologies are used in this exercise. The library code and the example program code are evaluated, reordered and partially paralleled. As a result, the total execution time is reduced by $56.62 \%$.

\section{Evaluation platform}

\subsection{Hardware platform}

\textbf{There are two testing platform used in this exercise. The primary platform is:}

Motherboard:    SABERTOOTH 990FX R2.0

CPU:    AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (4013.652 MHz)

RAM:    16199520 kiB

Disk:    OCZ-VERTEX4 SSD

\textbf{Secondary platform is used to run VTune and compared with primary platform:}

Motherboard:    ASUS Z170-DELUXE Desktop Motherboard

CPU:    INTEL Intel® Core™ i7-6700K Processor (8M Cache, up to 4.20 GHz)

RAM:    16199520 kiB

Disk:    2$\times$Crucial\_CT256MX100 SSD (RAID0)
\subsection{Software platform for primary hardware configuration}

OS:    Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)

Kernel:    Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64

Compiler:    gcc (Debian 4.9.2-10)

This hardware set is build as a customised Linux server without GUI. It has little overhead and it can be accessed anywhere through ssh. In addition, it is convenient to install and configure software development environment.

\subsection{Performance analysis tools}

\subsubsection{gprof}

Gprof is a profiling tool for Linux applications, it was used to simply call graphs by inserting instrumentation code. The limitation of Gprof is obvious, because timing data sampling is done by probing program counter using system interrupt, and the profiling data will not be very accurate.
\cite{graham1982gprof}

\subsubsection{valgrind(cachegrind)}

Valgrind \cite{nethercote2003valgrind} is an instrumentation framework for building performance analysis tools. It contains many different tools that can be used to evaluate different aspect of application performance. One particular tool used in this exercises is '\texttt{cachegrind}' \cite{seward2004cachegrind}, which can simulate the cache hierarchy performance. However, it has a major drawback, the simulation time is too long for large datasets.

\subsubsection{Linux perf}

Linux perf \cite{de2010new} is a powerful performance analysing tool in Linux system, it utilises Linux performance counter subsystem and has tracing capabilities. It can be used to observe different performance statistics including cycle count, instruction stalls, branch misses and cache misses, etc. The major advantage of this tool is that it can show in-depth details about time usage of individual functions and instructions. It also use less time compared with other profilers, therefore, Linux perf was chosen to be the primary tool used in later analysis.

\subsubsection{Intel VTune}

Vtune \cite{malladi2009using} is a software performance analysis tool developed by Intel. It can show whether the program is paralleled and the thread count used by each function as well as the time taken by each thread and function.  

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Example datasets}

The \texttt{CThead-2by2.256x512x226.uint16} is chosen to be used in this exercise. The reason for this choice is that the execution time for this dataset is around 12 seconds, thus suitable for rapid software development while keeping a reasonable problem size.

\subsection{Initial performance}

The tool used to measure time usage of the program is the built-in \texttt{time} function in bash. To ensure a representative result, multiple measurements were taken and then averaged. The time taken by the original program is $13.655 s$. In addition, Makefile was used to simplify the measuring process.

One unexpected phenomenon is observed when multiple instances are executed in parallel. The performance drops with increasing number of instances even if instances count does not excess the number of cores.

\section{Optimisations and evaluations}

The optimisations are divided into multiple parts, the different effect of enhancement is shown in the next \fref{fig:log}. 

Each program output was checked to ensure correct functionality of \texttt{libtourtre}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{data_log}
    \caption{The result of optimisation steps (...: last step repeated)}
    \label{fig:log}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Compiler Optimisation}

Level 3 optimisation will transform short function into in-line functions, which can save time used for function call. After compiler level 3 optimisation is turned on, the performance was improved by $1.92\%$.

\subsection{C++ library}

Changed the library to C++ for...
Changing the library to C++ files in order to test whether \texttt{Thread Building Blocks (TBB)} can be used in the optimisation, although \texttt{openmp} \cite{dagum1998openmp} was actually used for parallelisation due to its simplicity.

In addition, the example program is written by C++, and it is more convenient to use lambda function in the optimisation for \texttt{Mesh::find6Neighbours} and \texttt{Mesh::find18Neighbors}.

\subsection{Remove unnecessary memory allocations}

Several modifications has been made in \texttt{neighbors}, \texttt{find6Neighbors} and \texttt{find18Neighbors} function to remove an unnecessary intermediate \texttt{vector}. Instead, the pointer of the output memory space was passed directly to \texttt{findNNeighbors} functions. \lref{lst:neighbors} shows the modification of the code. An additional $10.87\%$ speed up was obtained.

\subsection{Unroll neighbours checking functions}

The original implementation of \texttt{find6Neighbors} and \texttt{find18Neighbors} functions involves very inefficient and complex array allocation, modification and comparison operations. As \lref{lst:find} shows, these were reduced to hard-coded coordinate checks. An additional $7.83 \%$ speed up was obtained.

 }
\end{lstlisting}

Further analysing of the \texttt{libtourtre} code shows the order of checks have no effect on the final result. By re-ordering the neighbour checks, ensuring only minimal coordinate changes in \texttt{xyz} dimensions exist between adjacent checks, another minor speed up of $1.55 \%$ was obtained. Manual coordinate check combination was also attempted, a similar speed up was obtained. This suggests the compiler was optimising the code as expected. To keep the code straightforward, the uncombined implementation was kept.

\subsection{Inline simple functions}

Data comparison functions \texttt{Data::less} and \texttt{Data::greater} were moved into the header file \texttt{Data.h} instead of their original source file \texttt{Data.cpp}. In addition, the \texttt{Mesh::getNeighbours} function was flagged in-line as well. Those functions are short and simple, but were called frequently. Implement them as in-line functions will remove the function call process and enable further optimisations, at the cost of potentially larger binary size. An additional speed up of $6.67 \%$ was obtained due to the increased efficiency. 

\subsection{Parallelise \texttt{createGraph}}

Using openmp to parallel \texttt{sort()} in \texttt{Mesh::createGraph}...
As the result shown on the gprof, the execution time of the \texttt{std::sort} occupies a large percentage of the whole program running time. Paralleling the \texttt{sort} function is a perfect technique to increasing the performance of \texttt{simple}. Using an existing paralleled sort library \cite{parallelsort} is a more effective and efficiency approach. The library has a function named as \texttt{pss::parallel\_stable\_sort()} and the function prototype is the same as the \texttt{std::sort()}. So it can be replaced directly when using the library.


\subsection{Parallelise \texttt{ct\_sweep}}

An attempt to parallelise the \texttt{findNeighbors} function inside \texttt{ct\_sweep} has been made. The code modification is shown by \lref{lst:sweep}.

It is possible to extract \texttt{ctx->neighbors} function call to a separate loop. By doing so, a large memory space must be allocated to store all the results of \texttt{nbrs} from every iteration. In the original implementation, the \texttt{maxValence} value was kept at the default value of 256. However, this results in a memory allocation of over $60 GiB$ for the sample dataset, which is inefficient to do and impossible on the primary testing platform.

To address the memory issue, the \texttt{maxValence} parameter was changed to 18 during initialisation, which is the maximum possible number of results generated from the \texttt{neighbors} function. This results in a far more practical memory allocation size for the same dataset, also the memory allocation becomes possible to be executed on the primary platform.

The \texttt{openmp parallel for} directive was then used for paralleling the extracted loop. However, this parallelisation implementation is not worthwhile. The execution time becomes even longer than the unoptimised original version. Manual partition of task blocks was also attempted, without any noticeable improvement. A manual block size of $500 k$ gives a relatively better performance, the result is shown on the last line of \fref{fig:log}.

The ineffective of the parallelisation was probably caused by the parallelisation overheads and significantly increased memory pressure. As \tref{tbl:sweep} suggests, the number of instructions, context switches, cache loads and cache misses for the parallelised version increased noticeably. Therefore, the parallelisation of \texttt{neighbors} was revoked.

\subsection{SIMD implementation of \texttt{Data::load}}

The load process can be implemented by SIMD instructions. The \texttt{Data:load} can be optimised by SIMD intrinsics as shown in \cite{advnotes}. Firstly, the input data is \texttt{intData} which contains multiple chars (8 bits), however the size of each element from \texttt{intData} is 16 bits. \texttt{\_\_mm\_packus\_epi16()} it needed to pack 16-bit elements from 2 inputs into 8-bit unsigned integers. \texttt{src1, src2} are declared as temporary container for the input data. However, it also involves a saturation function, that takes account of the higher 8-bits. To remove the invalid higher 8 bits, \texttt{\_\_mm\_and\_si128()} was used to compute the bitwise AND of 128-bit value in two arguments. In total, there are 16 chars inside one \texttt{pDst}, which means one iteration of the loop will load 16 elements, so the loop count should be \texttt{totalSize / 16}.

However, this requires 16 bits input data size to be aligned to 8 elements width. Since all sample datasets satisfy this requirement, further alignment check was not implemented.

\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=t,caption={Data Load with SIMD Intrinsics},captionpos=b,label=lst:mem]
data = new DataType[totalSize];
__m128i *pDst = (__m128i *) data;
...
__m128i *pSrc = (__m128i *) intData;
for (uint i = 0; i < totalSize / 16; i++) {
    //data[i] = static_cast<DataType>( intData[i] );
    __m128i src1 = _mm_and_si128(*pSrc++, _mm_set1_epi16(0x00ff));
    __m128i src2 = _mm_and_si128(*pSrc++, _mm_set1_epi16(0x00ff));
    *pDst++ = _mm_packus_epi16(src1, src2);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Remove redundant \texttt{memset}}

The function \texttt{calloc} is used to allocate customised size of memory and initialise all bytes inside this part of memory into 0. However, \texttt{memset} has the same purpose as the \texttt{calloc}, so there is no need to clear the memory again. After removing the \texttt{memset}, the total time is decreased by $0.82 \%$ as \fref{fig:log} shows. 

Furthermore, the function \texttt{calloc()} was changed to \texttt{malloc()}. It will not influence the result but the execution speed is decreased. It shows that although \texttt{calloc()} will do the memory allocation and memory initialisation together, it is still faster than \texttt{malloc()}. The reason for that is \texttt{calloc()} will do less initial work because it may skip memory allocation and \texttt{memset()} entirely in some cases, the kernel may gives a pseudo memory pointer without actually allocating the memory. Instead, the operations will be done only when the memory region is used later. After testing multiple times, \texttt{calloc} is not replaced by \texttt{malloc}

\subsection{Parallel \texttt{ct\_sweepAndMerge()}}
The longest time consumption is on function \texttt{sweep()}. This function was called twice by two separate functions named \texttt{ct\_joinSweep()} and \texttt{ct\_splitSweep()}. The argument of those two functions is \texttt{ctx}, but when they call \texttt{ct\_sweep}, all the parameters transferred to \texttt{ct\_sweep} are independent, which means \texttt{ct\_joinSweep()} and \texttt{ct\_sliptSweep()} can be parallelised. In order to gain better performance, \texttt{openmp parallel sections} is used inside \texttt{ct\_sweepAndMerge} as \lref{lst:secs} shows. This optimisation saves a significant amount of time as \fref{fig:log} describes. It decreases the execution time by more than $15 \%$ compared with the original implementation. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=t,caption={Data Load with SIMD Intrinsics},captionpos=b,label=lst:secs]
ctArc * ct_sweepAndMerge( ctContext * ctx )
{
    ct_checkContext(ctx);
    
#pragma omp parallel sections    
{    
#pragma omp section
    {ct_joinSweep(ctx);}
#pragma omp section
    {ct_splitSweep(ctx);}
}   
    ct_augment( ctx );
    return ctx->tree=ct_merge( ctx );
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Checking Results with VTune}

VTune was run in the secondary Intel platform. The first reason is that VTune is a sophisticated program so that it takes long time to set up. However, the primary AMD platform needs to have little overheads in order to get more accurate results, so the VTune is only installed on the secondary platform. It might be useful to compare the same program running on different processors.

After the previous optimisations, the execution time of program \texttt{simple} is 4.163s on the Intel platform. The difference between the time is due to the different processor architectures. The IPC of the program running on Intel platform is much higher than AMD platform, suggesting Intel CPU is more efficient than AMD for this particular problem.

The last step is checking the achievement of the optimisation. In order to see a obvious result, the largest dataset \texttt{CThead-2by4.256x512x452.uint16} is chosen as the input of program tested by VTune. Those two figures (\fref{fig:noopt} and \fref{fig:opt})below shows how the program  paralleled. There are three colors shown in results which describe how many CPU cores work simultaneously. Red means the program runs in series. Yellow means there are 2 to 6 threads running. Green gives the best result which represents that there are more than 6 Cores work at the same time. The \fref{fig:noopt} describes that the all the functions of the original program run sequentially. The second graph \fref{fig:opt} proves that after optimisation, most of functions are paralleled and the execution time is decreased significantly.
